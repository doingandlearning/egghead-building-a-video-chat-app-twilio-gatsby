# 2 - Create a React Form in Gatsby

[Video link](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-create-a-react-form-in-gatsby)

To let people join a room, we will need to create a form. We'll do that with a new component, specifically `components/join.js`.

In this component, we will import `React` and `useState` to keep track of the `identity` of the user and their `roomName`.

The component we will create won't take any props but will use the `useState` hook twice and then return the rendered component which initially will be a `<h1>`.

### components/join.js

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Join = () => {
  const [identity, setIdentity] = useState("");
  const [roomName, setRoomName] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Start or Join a Video Chat</h1>
    </>
  );
};
```

Next we can add our form element. To use the CSS provided, the className we should set is `start-form`.

### components/join.js

```jsx
const Join = () => {
  const [identity, setIdentity] = useState("");
  const [roomName, setRoomName] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Start or Join a Video Chat</h1>
      <form className="start-form"></form>
    </>
  );
};
```

Within that we will add our first input which will collect the identity. To make this be maximally-accessible we will use the `htmlFor` attribute on the `label` element which will match the `id` on the input.

The value will be the `identity` declared above and the onChange event will be using the `setIdentity` function with the `event.target.value` as the passed parameter.

### components/join.js

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Start or Join a Video Chat</h1>
  <form className="start-form">
    <label htmlFor="identity">
      Display name:
      <input
        type="text"
        id="identity"
        value={identity}
        onChange={event => setIdentity(event.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  </form>
</>
```

The next element for the `roomName` is exactly the same with different variable names.

### components/join.js

```jsx
<label htmlFor="roomName">
  Which room do you want to join?
  <input
    type="text"
    id="roomName"
    value={roomName}
    onChange={event => setRoomName(event.target.value)}
  />
</label>
```

To finish the form, we will add a button of type submit.

### components/join.js

```jsx
<label htmlFor="identity">
  Display name:
  <input
    type="text"
    id="identity"
    value={identity}
    onChange={event => setIdentity(event.target.value)}
  />
</label>
<label htmlFor="roomName">
  Which room do you want to join?
  <input
    type="text"
    id="roomName"
    value={roomName}
    onChange={event => setRoomName(event.target.value)}
  />
</label>
<button type="submit">Join Video Chat</button>
```

We finally need to export our `Join` component and we will have finished here for now. The final file at this point will look like:

### components/join.js

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Join = () => {
  const [identity, setIdentity] = useState("");
  const [roomName, setRoomName] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Start of Join a Video Call</h1>
      <form className="start-form">
        <label htmlFor="identity">
          Display name:
          <input
            type="text"
            id="identity"
            value={identity}
            onChange={event => setIdentity(event.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        <label htmlFor="roomName">
          Which room do you want to join?
          <input
            type="text"
            id="roomName"
            value={roomName}
            onChange={event => setRoomName(event.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Join room</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
};

export default Join;
```

We need to actually put this on our home page. To use it, we will `import Join from './components/join` at the top of `index.js` and then we can swap out our `<h1>`.

### pages/index.js

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/layout";
import Join from "../components/join";

const Index = () => (
  <Layout>
    <Join />
  </Layout>
);

export default Index;
```

If you've left the Gatsby server running, the page should have automatically updated and you should see this.

The form is there but when you try to use it nothing happens. The next lesson will be concerned with handling the form submission.

## Personal take

Adding a form component, using useState hooks and importing component to page. Not dealing with submission handler yet. This acts as a good refresher if you haven't touched on these things recently. Well-structured components and design patterns that can be used elsewhere.
